		<p> Finding parking is an issue that concerns students. It is difficult to find parking close to classes, 
		unless one takes an 8 a.m. class. Students often leave an hour early to find parking. Or if students leave 
		on time or late, they often discover that finding a parking spot is extremely difficult. Sometimes this causes
		students to be late to class or even miss a good portion of the lecture. How do students cope with the parking
		situation? What do you do to find a place to park? Please discuss.
