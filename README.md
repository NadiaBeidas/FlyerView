# FlyerView

Instructions:
Open Git Bash
Go to your directory,
git clone https://github.com/NadiaBeidas/FlyerView.git

This project used to be up-to-date on Heroku at: https://flyer-view.herokuapp.com/
However, we decided to make our database local because the Heroku database could potentially charge us and this is only a class project.
transitioning to a non-local databse would be easy though.

View the project:
    install npm
    install node
    install xampp
    in a terminal (like git bash), execute the following commands:
        npm install -g nodemon
        npm install body-parser
        npm install ejs
    Then  do the following:
    start xampp (control panel), start MySQL in the panel, open shell at right of panel, type into the shell "mysql -u root", then copy paste the contents of the file flyerViewSetUp.sql into the shell. (you only have to do this step the very first time)
    In your terminal, type nodemon
    Open a web browser and go to localhost:3000

This project will allow students to discuss campus events and current events.
At the end of phase III, the team has an implemented server.
In addition, the website for the Flyer View has a home page, a campus events page, and a current events page.
